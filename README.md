### Hi there üëã

## This is a list of public projects I'm proud of:

1. [reetou/tinkoff-invest-elixir](https://github.com/reetou/tinkoff-invest-elixir) - Elixir SDK for Tinkoff Invest REST API. 
2. [reetou/trader_ex](https://github.com/reetou/trader_ex) - Telegram trader bot written on Elixir using Tinkoff Invest SDK for Elixir. Not documented mostly, but I put my soul in it. 
3. [reetou/mnogobot](https://github.com/reetou/mnogobot) - DSL for writing social media bots. Not 100% working, but cool concept and syntax
4. [reetou/croc](https://github.com/reetou/croc) - Monopoly game like monopoly-one but for VK.com. Was rejected because of design, my first big pet-project with Elixir + Phoenix stack, a lot of tests here.
5. [reetou/apper](https://github.com/reetou/apper) - Mobile app builder. Construct your app via web interface using react-native-web, save it as json and then create a project from it. Wasn't released but cool concept and was fully working for iOS. I used Gitlab pipelines for building bundles and limited it to 1 concurrent job in order to simplify request queue handling. Visit demo here: [https://apper.vercel.app/demo](https://apper.vercel.app/demo)
6. [reetou/apperback](https://github.com/reetou/apperback) - Elixir backend for Apper.
9. [reetou/black_sail](https://github.com/reetou/black_sail) - Elixir discord bot for my CS:GO Discord server written using Nostrum library. This bot can create complicated chat rooms with managing access by users themselves, play sound in voice channels and much more. Users can request to create a room just for them and allow only certain people to connect to it. Users also can enter their faceIT accounts and link their data on the server. People can post search messages where their current voice room will be available through a link. Very interesting bot, I really like it and spent a lot of time writing integration tests for it üêù.
10. [reetou/cloudflare_stream_ex](https://github.com/reetou/cloudflare_stream_ex) - Elixir library for Cloudflare Stream with convenient functions. Because cloudflare stream does not fully follow tus protocol there will be 500 errors if you use it with standard tus_ex library so I modified it and put in a separate module. You can also parse video metadata using this library.
